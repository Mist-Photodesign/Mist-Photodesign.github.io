            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>As a visual artist, my primary focus lies in the domain of CGI, where I leverage my expertise in
                photography to provide
                a distinctive viewpoint to this medium. Drawing inspiration from this experience, I strive to create
                artworks that stand
                out and leave a lasting impression. My work spans across a variety of mediums, including video games,
                web development,
                and stand-alone CGI art pieces. My artistic vision is diverse, ranging from photorealistic product CGI
                to abstract
                geometric art. Sometimes, I combine these two styles to create stunning and unexpected outcomes. My
                upcoming exhibition at
                the Free Range Gallery in London (June - July of 2023) is a testament to the range of my work.
                <br></br>
                In my photorealistic CGI which depicts products designed by me, I focus on creating procedural materials
                that accurately
                depict real-life objects. I pay close attention to detail to create an authentic representation of the
                subject matter.
                While designing the products I conduct thorough research to ensure that my work is faithful to reality
                and also adds
                value by enhancing existing designs. In the pursuit of creating impactful product videos, I aim to
                infuse a distinctive
                touch by incorporating intricate fluid simulations, unorthodox lighting techniques, and captivating
                camera movements,
                often combining multiple techniques that synergistically come together to enhance the overall visual
                appeal of the final
                output.
                <br></br>
                My abstract CG art, on the other hand, explores the transformation of strong geometric shapes as well as
                bending
                reality to
                create a unique and mesmerizing experience. I aim to push the boundaries of what is possible within CGI
                and explore the abstract world with the art I produce.
